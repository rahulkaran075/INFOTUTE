INFOTUTE is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between users and training institutes, making it easier for individuals to find and connect with educational institutions that offer various training programs. The platform provides users with comprehensive details about different institutes, including the courses they offer, their location, fees, and other relevant information. This allows users to make informed decisions about which institute suits their educational or professional needs.

The application is built using a range of technologies to ensure efficiency, responsiveness, and ease of use. Java is used for the backend logic, enabling smooth data processing and interaction with the database. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are utilized for the front-end design, ensuring the platform is both visually appealing and responsive across different devices. JSP (JavaServer Pages) is employed to handle dynamic web content, allowing the platform to display real-time data from the server, while JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) facilitates the connection between the application and the MySQL database. The MySQL database stores all the information related to the institutes, courses, and users, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

Overall, INFOTUTE provides a user-friendly interface where users can browse, search, and explore training institutes based on their preferences, while institutes can manage and update their profiles. The platform aims to enhance the experience of finding educational opportunities by centralizing all necessary information in one place.
